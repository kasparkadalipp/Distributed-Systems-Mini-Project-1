# Distributed tic-tac-toe

This project was implemented as part of the distributed systems course by following authors:
- Kaspar Kadalipp
- Daniel WÃ¼rsch
- Joshua Katigbak

## Requirements

Required applications:
* [etcd](https://etcd.io/)

Required python libraries:
* [etcd3](https://pypi.org/project/etcd3/)
* protobuf
* grpcio

## Running

### etcd

`etcd` needs to be available for nodes and should be started. In case nodes are remote, `etcd` needs to be started to allow remote connections:

```
etcd --listen-client-urls 'http://0.0.0.0:2379' --advertise-client-urls 'http://0.0.0.0:2379'
```

### Nodes

Nodes can be started with following command:

```
python -i tictactoe.py port [etcd_host:etcd_port]
```

`etcd` host and port can be omitted in which case `localhost:2379` will be used.

## Design decisions

### Assumptions

* No authentication has been implemented, it's assumed all nodes are trusted entities and won't misbehave.

### Service discovery

To avoid hardcoding the nodes and allow dynamically adding and removing of nodes, `etcd` is used for service discovery purposes.

Each node registers itself periodically with `etcd` and announces its address and port where it is listening for incoming request.

### Leader election

Leader election is performed automatically as background task using bullying algorithm.

Lowest process id will be elected as the leader. This is to avoid frequent changes of leaders in case new nodes are joining the cluster and try to assume leader roles. (Because leader node is responsible for the games, and based on task description leader change will result in game state reset)

### Time synchronization

Time synchronization is performed automatically by the leader node as background task. Each nodes time is defined by the system clock and an offset which may be adjusted by the leader.
